# Socket-Based Web Server

## Description
Socket-based web server implemented in C++ that handles HTTP requests and serves static files over TCP.

## Technologies
- C++
- TCP/IP
- Socket Programming
- HTTP
- Linux / Unix

## Overview
This project implements a basic web server using low-level TCP sockets in C++. The server listens for incoming connections, parses HTTP requests, and responds by serving static content such as HTML files and images.

## Key Concepts
- TCP socket creation and connection handling
- HTTP request parsing
- Serving static files over HTTP
- Client-server architecture
- Basic logging and error handling

## Features
- Handles HTTP GET requests
- Serves static HTML and image files
- Supports multiple requests sequentially

## Notes
This project was developed as part of a computer networks course and focuses on understanding networking and HTTP fundamentals rather than production-level performance.
